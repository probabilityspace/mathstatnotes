<p><span class="newthought">This chapter</span> is <b>very</b> elementary and is not at all representative of the overall level of these notes. 
This chapter is also a strange sort of introduction to probability in its coverage. Some very basic central concepts and even notation for 
understanding probability are completely absent. Instead, it contains only the bare minimum of topics needed in order to understand the subsequent 
chapters. For those students who insist on trying mathematical statistics without a basic probability background, this should help. For others 
already familiar with things like random variables, "pdfs", "cdfs", and expectations, it may be helpful to only skim Sections 0.1 through 0.7 since 
they will serve to establish some basic terminology and notation. Sections 0.8-0.10 are recommended reading for everyone!

<h2 id="preliminaries">Between Zero and One</h2>

<p>
If you flip a ``fair'' coin, what is the probability that it will come up
``heads''?

Most people have at least a sense of what this question is asking
without any formal training in probability. Many will use the words
"probability" and "chance" interchangeably and say:


"There is a 50 percent chance of it coming up heads.""



This is not wrong but, <b>formally</b>, in mathematics <i>probability is a number between zero and one</i>.

So, the more precise answer to the original question is 1/2 or 0.5.
</p>

<br><br>
<p>If you roll a "fair" six-sided die, what is the probability that you will get a 5?

In the case of the coin and now the die, the word "fair" is there to say that there is nothing funny going on. The coin isn't warped, 
the die isn't shaved or repainted with extra dots, and the acts of flipping and rolling are not done  in  a way that favors one outcome over 
another. For the coin, the two outcomes "heads" and "tails" are <b>equally likely</b>, and for the die, the six outcomes are equally likely.

To answer the question, since the outcome we care about (getting a 5) is one outcome out of six equally likely outcomes, the probability of getting a 5 is 1/6.
</p>



<br><br>
<p>If you roll a fair six-sided die, what is the probability that you will get either a  5 or a 6?

Since there are now 2 outcomes out of 6 equally likely outcomes that we care about, the answer is 2/6 or 1/3.
</p>

outcomes for an experiment, the probability that a certain event occurs is the number of outcomes in the event of interest divided by
the number of possible outcomes.</p></h3box></center></div>

<p>
Thus, in order to compute probabilities in the case of equally likely outcomes, it is important for us to be able to count things!
