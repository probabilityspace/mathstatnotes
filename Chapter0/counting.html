<p>How many different ways can you list the integers 1 through 4 in various orders? Two examples are</p>
<center>
<p>
3 &nbsp 2 &nbsp 1 &nbsp 4  &nbsp &nbsp and &nbsp &nbsp 2 &nbsp 4 &nbsp 1 &nbsp 3 ,
</p>
</center>

<br>
<p>but there are obviously many more possibilities.</p>

<br>
<p>The first number in the list can be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4. Let's visualize them as branches of a tree.</p>

<p>If we start our list with 1, for example, the next number can be 2 or 3 or 4. If we start our list with 2, 
the next number can be one of 1 or 3 or 4. In general, possibilities for ``next numbers",  can be envisioned like this
Following any path from top to bottom will give a different configuration of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 and all 
possible configurations are shown. There are 4 branches at the top. Each has 3 offshoots, making 
\(4 \times 3 = 12\) "second level branches". Each of those has 2 offshoots, making \(4 \times 3 \times 2=24\)
"third level branches" and finally, each of those has one final offshoot making 
\(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24\) total branches representing configurations of 1, 2, 3,
and 4. Of course, we do not need to multiply by 1, but it gives a nice sense of completeness 
don't you think?
</p>


<div style="background-color: #cdd8e1; color: #284b68; border: solid 2px #284b68; border-radius: 1em; margin: 2em; padding: 1em;">
<center><h3box><p style="line-height:120%; font-size:100%;"> 
For any positive integer \(n\), the symbol "\(n!\)" is read as "<b>n factorial</b>" and is defined as
$$
n! := n (n-1) (n-2) \cdots (2)(1).
$$

By convention (so that all will be right with the world and so that certain generalizations will go smoothly) we define \(0!:=1\).
</p></h3box></center></div>

<p>From the tree diagram above, we have seen that the number of ways to arrange 4 distinct 
numbers  (or people, objects, or "things") is \(4!=(4)(3)(2)(1)=24\).
</p>

<div style="background-color: #cdd8e1; color: #284b68; border: solid 2px #284b68; border-radius: 1em; margin: 2em; padding: 1em;">
<center><h3box><p style="line-height:120%; font-size:100%;"> 
In general,
$$
n! = \mbox{the number of ways to arrange \(n\) distinct objects.}
$$
</p></h3box></center></div>

<p>
From our little tree drawing experiment, we have learned at least two other things. First, 
if the numbers can be "reused", the number of branches will not decrease. For example, if we 
roll a fair 6-sided die 4 times we could see outcomes like
$$
3 \,\,\,\, 5 \,\,\,\, 3 \,\,\,\, 4  \qquad \mbox{and}  \qquad 2 \,\,\,\, 1 \,\,\,\, 1 \,\,\,\, 1 .
$$
The total number of possible outcomes will be 6 (first branches) times 6 (second branches) times 
6 (third branches) times 6 (fourth branches), for a total of \(6^{4} = 1296\) possible outcomes. 

At this point we could make another fancy box saying something like: 
"If we perform an experiment with \(k\) trials and with \(n\) possible outcomes for each trial, 
we have a total of \(n^{k}\) possible outcomes for the entire experiment."  However, 
<b>we won't and you shouldn't either</b>.  If you are memorizing things for a math class 
(outside of definitions), the class will get more and more and more difficult as you pile up 
information in your head and eventually struggle to access it.  If you are memorizing things 
for a math class, you are going to be thrown off when problems have only subtle differences 
from ones you've already seen or solved. On the other hand, if you <b>understand</b> and think 
about what you're doing at each step, the class will get easier and easier even as the material 
gets more complex!
